<hr>
<p>The food culture can vary a lot as China is such a large country. Chinese takeaways aren't really representative<br>
of the cuisine.</p><br>

<p>If you go to Chinatown in Leicester Square, the cuisine there represents mainly Hong kong/Cantonese<br>
cuisine. Here are some variations of Chinese cuisine and what dishes they may serve.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cantonese/Hong Kong cuisine: There are things like Char Siu Pork and something we call Yum cha which is a cuisine enjoyed at afternoon<br>
and it includes Dim Sum which is a variety of steamed pastries, fried pastries and more.</li>

<li>Sichuan cuisine: Another cuisine in China is the Sichuan cuisine. This comes from the Sichuan province in western China.<br>
This cuisine is very spice and usually includes spicy hotpot, twice cooked pork and mapo doufu.</li>

<li>Beijing cuisine: This cuisine includes dishes like Peking duck, Peking barbeque, Chinese dumplings, Zhajiangmian<br>
(noodle dish) and Douzhi.</li>
