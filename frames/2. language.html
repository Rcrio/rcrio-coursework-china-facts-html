<H2><center>The Chinese language</center></H2>
<hr>
<p>The main language spoken in China is Mandarin. The writing is in simplified Chinese.<br>
It used to be purely traditional Chinese but the Chinese government changed the writing to<br>
simplified Chinese during 1955 because too many Chinese people were illiterate so they decided<br>
to simplify the language. Most Chinese characters were simplified but some of them stayed as their traditional form<br>
because they could not be simplified any further.<br>
Generally, some people know traditional Chinese but nearly everyone knows simplified Chinese in Mainland China.</p><br>

<p>When it comes to Hong Kong and Taiwan, they mainly teach and use traditional Chinese. Hong Kong people speak Cantonese<br>
and people from Taiwan speak Taiwanese. They cannot understand each other vocally unless if they already know each other's<br>
language. This goes for Mandarin-speaking people as well. People from Hong Kong will still see or may even use simplified Chinese<br>
due to China's influence on it. Due to politics, there may be further action to push simplified Chinese onto Hong Kong, but they<br>
traditionally use traditional Chinese.</p><br>
<p>
When writing simplified Chinese or traditional Chinese, it is best practice to follow a stroke order to replicate the charatcer<br>
completely. Due to the digtial revolution of the world, it is becoming less important to follow stroke orders because<br>
you can just type the character out completely without actually writing it. However, stroke order is an important part<br>
of the culture and it is the foundation of calligraphy which is an artform of our characters.</p>
